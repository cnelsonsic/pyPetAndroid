Getting Started:
To edit and run pypetandroid, you will need python and pygame installed.
cd into the "pet" directory and run main.py. It's not smart enough yet 
to be run outside of that directory.

Getting Started on Android:
If you want to build for android, you'll need "Pygame Subset for Android"
installed on your phone.
You'll also want the latest tar.bz2 at <http://pygame.renpy.org/dl/>.
For example: <http://pygame.renpy.org/dl/pygame-package-0.9.3.tar.bz2>

You'll also need java, ant, the JDK, as well as the Android SDK.
As per the documentation at <http://pygame.renpy.org/releasing.html>:
"build.py expects that Python, Java, Ant, and the tools directory of
the Android SDK are in your path. You should be able to run python,
javac, ant, and android without having to give a path explicitly."

Building for Android:
if you run build.sh from within the project directory, it should 
(theoretically) build the entire thing and upload it to your phone.
It needs to be plugged in. It's not magic.
